They were back. <br>

The place's beauty never failed to disappoint. <br>
And it didn't disappoint this time. <br>

They touched the same spots they used to and smelled the same scent.<br>
They saw the same lights and felt the same warmth. <br>
Even the taste was the same. <br>

Like last time, it felt like all they ever wanted and it pulled them deeper and deeper with every passing second.<br>
Were they further than they'd ever been or had they forgotten how far they'd come?<br>

They couldn't tell how fast they were going or for how long they had been.<br>
But again it didn't matter.<br>
The path leads to the same destination, the length doesn't matter. <br>

When they reached the center, they remembered what was coming, yet hesitated to jump.<br>
One last breath and one last tear. <br>

The memories of all the times they've been here danced through their mind as they fell. <br>
They barely fought the fall this time. <br>

"Will I ever be back?"<br>

They asked. <br>

"Will you ever stop coming?" <br>

It answered. <br>
