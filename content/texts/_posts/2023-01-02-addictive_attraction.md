They were back. <br>

The place's beauty never failed to disappoint. <br>
And it didn't disappoint this time. <br>

They touched the same spots they used to and smelled the same smell.<br>
They saw the same lights and felt the same warmth. <br>
Even the taste was the same. <br>

Like last time it felt like all they ever wanted and it dragged them deeper and deeper with every second passing.<br>
Were they farther than they've ever been or did they forget how far they came?<br>
They couldn't tell how fast they’re walking and how long they’ve been.<br>

Yet all didn't matter again.<br>

The way leads to the same destination, the length doesn't matter. <br>

As they reached the center they knew what was coming yet hesitated to jump. <br>

One last breath and one last tear. <br>

The memories of the other times danced through their mind while they fell. <br>
They barely fought the fall this time. <br>

"Will I ever be back?"<br>

They asked. <br>

"Will you ever stop coming?" <br>

It answered. <br>
