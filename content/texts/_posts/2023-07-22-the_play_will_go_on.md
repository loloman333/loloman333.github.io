Some time, an actor will die <br>
Fast and cruel or slow and peaceful <br>
Public and loud or private and quiet <br>
Once you realize, there is no return <br>

The whole play will be senseless <br>
Boring, sad and dull <br>
Too dramatic, hasty and cheerful <br>
But time will pass and you will cope <br>

You will look for replacement <br>
Too small and too large <br>
Too much and not enough <br>
You will find nothing that fits <br>

The play will never be the same <br>
But it may be good again <br>
Just remember <br>
Replace not the actor, but the role <br>
