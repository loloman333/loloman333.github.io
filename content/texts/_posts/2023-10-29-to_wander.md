The vision is moving yet fixed to a cause <br>
The cause is an actor, that changes disguise <br>
Disguises keep coming again and again <br>
Again we are moving, in circles we ran <br>

To wander seems reason of why we are here <br>
Here where we stumble and fail to hold dear <br>
Hold dear what is there and not what could be <br>
Could be we are built to wander and not to see <br>

Wherever we end up, we never yet reached <br>
Reached what we wanted and what we have preached <br>
We preached and we dreamed of what might one time come <br>
Come the desired and we want the next one <br>

To wander is clearly what makes us forget <br>
Forget that there is nothing that is truly consummate <br>
Yet if consummate is what all of us crave <br>
Then this craving all turns us into mere slaves <br>

How do we escape this hellish demise? <br>
How do we reach the ultimate prize? <br>
How do we find what never was lost? <br>
How do we pay and what is the cost? <br>

And what if there is no way to reach what we seek? <br>
How do we cope with a vision so bleak? <br>
The question still stands and never as strong <br>
Maybe the answer is to just wander on <br>
