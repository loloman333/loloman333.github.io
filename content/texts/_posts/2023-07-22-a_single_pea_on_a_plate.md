One is always alone in their feelings <br>
Noone can feel what another one does <br>

Sharing the feeling is to flatten it <br>
It’s to reduce the scope, to remove dimensions <br>

Even worse, by sharing the feeling one’s changing it <br>
One tries to adapt it to another one's view <br>

Not only the representation will be merely a pitiful copy <br>
But also the original will take its marks from it <br>
