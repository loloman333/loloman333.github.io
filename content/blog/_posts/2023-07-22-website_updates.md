# Lolo Place Version 1.0 is up!

I finished the ToDos from the last post and also created a seperate page for texts.
 
[Here](/texts) you can now find various texts I wrote, mostly small poems or thoughts I wanted to emphasize.
For now I imported some older ones. In the future I hope I'll add more to the collection.

Some things on this page still look sort of rough (the [tags page](/tags) for example) but honestly I don't want to waste too much time with adapting the template I'm using if the functionality is sufficient for now.

Next up I will try to document and publish some projects I worked on in the past.
This will probably take some time, since they are kind of scattered but I am looking forward to finally having a nice overview.

Why again did I think I would need a website?

If anyone is actually reading this, feel free to leave a comment!
