Yes, this is nerdy Minecraft content feel free to leave if you're not interested in that ðŸ˜Ž

### What are Datapacks?
I guess I don't have to explain Minecraft to you if you clicked this project, but the concept of datapacks might not be familiar to everyone.
Basically a datapack is a folder one can add to their Minecraft save to further customize their experience in the game.
This includes adding custom functions, advancements, dimensions, items, recipes, biomes and much more.
In many ways for the user this can feel like installing a mod. The differences lie in the implementation and the capabilities.
Mods are written in Java and have to be installed with a mod loader, while datapacks are "written" in various Minecraft specific files, mostly in json or mcfunction format.
Generally mods are more powerful and datapacks are  more lightweight and easier to "install".
[Here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack) you can read more if you're interested.

### What did I do?
I mostly used `.mcfunction` files for my datapacks. With these files one can group [commands](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands) together and also have some of them be executed every tick in the game.
This means that both projects could have been done with only command blocks as well. 
Using a datapack made it a lot easier to implement and share with others and probably also helps with performance.
But enough of this, what is the deal?
