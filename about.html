                My name is <b>Lorenz Killer</b>. <br>
                I'm a computer science student and like to work on personal projects from time to time. 
                They range from silly games to interesting prototypes or proof of concepts.<br>
                I also love writing texts, bouldering and days where you have no agenda and just flow through the day with whatever comes to your mind.

                This is a virtual place in the cloud. <br>
                It is called a website and hosts information I choose.
                Here you can find some of my projects, namely the ones I have published and managed to write some description about. <br>
                There are also some of my texts and posts for you to read if you're bored. Just don't you dare calling it a blog!
