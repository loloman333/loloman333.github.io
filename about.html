                My name is <b>Lorenz Killer</b> and I'm a computer science student. 
                I like to work on personal projects from time to time. 
                They range from silly games over interesting prototypes to pseudo-intellectual texts.
                I also love bouldering and days where you have no agenda and just flow through the day with whatever comes to my mind.
